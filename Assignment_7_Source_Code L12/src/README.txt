Project:
	DNA

Purpose: 
	Print out dna sequences.

Developer notes: 
	This is not a big deal but I looked up the stop codons (what a nerd) for dna, and I noticed that "TGA" was in the sequence, but the sequence kept printing nucliotides. 
I just think its pretty bad a$$ that you guys are defying the laws of nature. Time is just a construct, we're all living in a simulation. jk.


Project:
	Rabbit

Purpose: 
	unknown-- maybe for a good grade and extra credit. This program will randomly generate a "hole" where the user will then attempt to guess where the rabbit is hidden.
maybe the devoloper will go back and add lives for the user to make the game for fun.

Developer notes:
	To test Rabbit program, remove the "//" on line 67 to print the right asnwer
